# Online-Quiz-Application-by-priya
The Online Quiz App is a C++ console-based project that lets users register, log in, and take a multiple-choice quiz. Questions are read from a file, scores are calculated, and results are saved. Built using basic file handling and control structures, it runs in Notepad and Command Prompt without external libraries.
